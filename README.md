#  Banana Brush

Banana Brush is an AI powered creative studio designed to make advanced photo editing easy and accessible, with the **gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview** model at its core. Our application is built entirely around Gemini's multimodal editing capabilities, which are central to our primary features.  

##  Features

###  Magic Fill  
Our Magic Fill tool utilizes Gemini's powerful inpainting, allowing users to replace objects or imperfections by simply brushing over an area and describing the desired change in a text prompt.  

###  Insert Image  
The Insert Image feature showcases Gemini's advanced composition skills. It seamlessly blends a new, user uploaded object into an existing photo with realistic lighting and shadows, guided by multiple image inputs including the original, a composite, and a placement mask.  

###  Magic Expand  
Magic Expand leverages Gemini's outpainting ability to intelligently extend an image's canvas. It generates new, context aware content in the expanded space based on a user’s prompt, creating larger and more detailed scenes.  

###  Create Image  
Create Image allows users to generate brand new images directly from a text prompt. Whether it’s a concept, a scene, or an abstract idea, Gemini brings imagination to life in seconds.
